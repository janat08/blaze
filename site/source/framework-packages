title: Pattern Blaze after other frameworks
description: Extending Blaze such that it fits React.js and Vue.js patterns
---

If you wish for extensibility of react.js or "ease-of-use" of vue.js there're blaze packages that pattern blaze after them 
while retaining first rate compatibility with meteor.js and atmosphere packages. Meteor guide goes into some detail in comparing
front end frameworks, [official comparison](https://guide.meteor.com/ui-ux.html#syntax), meanwhile 
[components library](https://github.com/peerlibrary/meteor-blaze-components#related-projects) compares all blaze packages.

[React pattern package for blaze](github.com/peerlibrary/meteor-blaze-components) and [Vue.js](https://github.com/ManuelDeLeon/viewmodel).
In spirit of competition, since it's impossible to simply use blaze outside of meteor builder in interest of rebuild speeds, there's 
package that has meteor builder seat back and reloads components itself: https://github.com/qualialabs/reval
